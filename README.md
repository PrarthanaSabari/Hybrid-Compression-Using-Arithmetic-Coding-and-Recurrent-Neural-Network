# 🚀 Hybrid Data Compression Using Arithmetic Coding & Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

> **A hybrid lossless compression framework that integrates LSTM-based neural probability modeling with Arithmetic Coding to achieve significantly higher compression efficiency compared to the traditional Shannon–Fano algorithm.**

This repository contains all implementation files, notebooks, reports, and presentations for the ADCT (Advanced Data Compression Techniques) course project.

## ⭐ Project Highlights

### 🔥 Why a Hybrid Model?

Traditional compression methods like **Shannon–Fano** use static probabilities, assigning codes based only on global symbol frequency. This is inefficient for data where patterns are contextual.

This project overcomes these limitations by using an **RNN (LSTM)** to predict adaptive, context-based probabilities for each symbol. These highly accurate, dynamic probabilities are then fed into an **Arithmetic Coder**, which can achieve near-optimal, fractional-bit compression.

### 📉 Results at a Glance

The hybrid approach achieves approximately **4 times better compression** than the baseline Shannon–Fano algorithm on the test data.

| Method | Original Size | Compressed Size | Compression Ratio | Size Reduction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shannon–Fano** | 6254 bytes | 3563 bytes | 0.570× | 43.0% |
| **RNN + Arithmetic (Proposed)** | 6254 bytes | **900 bytes** | **0.144×** | **85.6%** |

## 🧠 System Overview

1.  **Input & Preprocessing**: The input file is read as raw bytes and converted into a tensor for the neural network.

2.  **RNN Probability Modeling**: An LSTM network processes the byte sequence, learns byte-level dependencies, and predicts the probability distribution for the *next* byte.

3.  **Softmax Conversion**: The raw output (logits) from the RNN is converted into a valid probability distribution using the Softmax function:
    $$P(x) = \frac{e^{z(x)}}{\sum_{k} e^{z(k)}}$$

4.  **Arithmetic Encoding**: The Arithmetic Encoder uses the adaptive probabilities from the RNN to progressively shrink a numerical interval for the entire file, resulting in a single, highly compact compressed output.

5.  **Arithmetic Decoding**: The decoder uses an identical, synchronized RNN model to recompute the *exact same* probability predictions during decompression, allowing it to perfectly reconstruct the original file from the compressed data.

6.  **Verification**: **SHA-256** hashes of the original and restored files are compared to confirm the compression is 100% lossless.

## 📈 Advantages
Learns Structure: The RNN model can learn long-term dependencies and complex structures in the data, unlike static models.

Accurate Probabilities: Produces highly accurate, context-specific probabilities, which is the key to high compression.

Near-Optimal: Arithmetic coding achieves compression ratios very close to the theoretical limit (entropy) defined by the probability model.

Universal: Works well on various file types, especially those with repetitive or complex patterns (like text, code, or structured data).

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
Model Architecture: Replace the RNN/LSTM with more modern architectures like GRU or a Transformer-based model for potentially better probability modeling.

Speed & Optimization: Improve training speed and implement batched inference for faster encoding/decoding.

Standalone Tool: Build a standalone desktop application (e.g., using PyQT or Tkinter) for easier use.

Data Types: Extend the framework to specialize in other data types, such as images, audio, or video.

Model Quantization: Apply model compression (e.g., quantization) for deployment on low-resource or mobile devices.
